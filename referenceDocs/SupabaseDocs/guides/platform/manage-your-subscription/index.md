## Manage your subscription plan[#](#manage-your-subscription-plan)

To change your subscription plan

1.  On the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing), go to section **Subscription Plan**
2.  Click **Change subscription plan**
3.  On the side panel, choose a subscription plan
4.  Follow the prompts

### Upgrade[#](#upgrade)

Upgrades take effect immediately. During the process, you are informed of the associated costs.

If you still have credits in your account, we will use the credits first before charging your card.

### Downgrade[#](#downgrade)

Downgrades take effect immediately. During the process, you are informed of the implications.

#### Credits upon downgrade[#](#credits-upon-downgrade)

Upon subscription downgrade, any prepaid subscription fee will be credited back to your organization for unused time in the billing cycle. These credits do not expire and will be applied to future invoices.

**Example:** If you start a Pro Plan subscription on January 1 and downgrade to the Free Plan on January 15, your organization will receive about 50% of the subscription fee as credits for the unused time between January 15 and January 31.

As stated in our [Terms of Service](https://supabase.com/terms#1-fees), we do not offer refunds to the payment method on file.

#### Charges on downgrade[#](#charges-on-downgrade)

When you downgrade from a paid plan to the Free Plan, you will get credits for the unused time on the paid plan. However, you will also be charged for any excessive usage in the billing cycle.

The plan line item (e.g. Pro Plan) gets charged upfront, whereas all usage charges get charged in arrears, as we only know your usage by the end of the billing cycle. Excessive usage is charged whenever a billing cycle resets, so either when your monthly cycle resets, or whenever you do a plan change.

If you got charged after downgrading to the Free Plan, you had excessive usage in the previous billing cycle. You can check your invoices to see what exactly you were charged for.
