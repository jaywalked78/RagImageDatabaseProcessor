Supabase Security

* * *

Supabase is a hosted platform which makes it very simple to get started without needing to manage any infrastructure. The hosted platform comes with many security and compliance controls managed by Supabase.

# Compliance

Supabase is SOC 2 Type 2 compliant and regularly audited. All projects at Supabase are governed by the same set of compliance controls. The [SOC 2 Compliance Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/soc-2-compliance) explains Supabase's SOC 2 responsibilities and controls in more detail.

The [HIPAA Compliance Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/hipaa-compliance) explains Supabase's HIPAA responsibilities. Additional [security and compliance controls](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/shared-responsibility-model#managing-healthcare-data) for projects that deal with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and require HIPAA compliance are available through the HIPAA add-on.
