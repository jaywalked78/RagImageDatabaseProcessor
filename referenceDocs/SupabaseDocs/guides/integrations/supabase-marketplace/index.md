Supabase Marketplace

* * *

The Supabase Marketplace brings together all the tools you need to extend your Supabase project. This includes:

-   [Experts](https://supabase.com/partners/experts) - partners to help you build and support your Supabase project.
-   [Integrations](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations) - extend your projects with external Auth, Caching, Hosting, and Low-code tools.

## Build an integration[#](#build-an-integration)

Supabase provides several integration points:

-   The [Postgres connection](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres). Anything that works with Postgres also works with Supabase projects.
-   The [Project REST API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#rest-api-overview) & client libraries.
-   The [Project GraphQL API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#graphql-api-overview).
-   The [Platform API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api).

## List your integration[#](#list-your-integration)

[Apply to the Partners program](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations#become-a-partner) to list your integration in the Partners marketplace and in the Supabase docs.

Integrations are assessed on the following criteria:

-   **Business viability** While we welcome everyone to built an integration, we only list companies that are deemed to be long-term viable. This includes an official business registration and bank account, meaningful revenue, or Venture Capital backing. We require this criteria to ensure the health of the marketplace.
-   **Compliance** Integrations should not infringe on the Supabase brand/trademark. In short, you cannot use "Supabase" in the name. As the listing appears on the Supabase domain, we don't want to mislead developers into thinking that an integration is an official product.
-   **Service Level Agreements** All listings are required to have their own Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy, and the company must have resources to meet their SLAs.
-   **Maintainability** All integrations are required to be maintained and functional with Supabase, and the company may be assessed on your ability to remain functional over a long time horizon.
