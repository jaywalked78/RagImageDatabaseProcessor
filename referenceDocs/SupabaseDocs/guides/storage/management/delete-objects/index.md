Delete Objects

## 

Learn about deleting objects

* * *

When you delete one or more objects from a bucket, the files are permanently removed and not recoverable. You can delete a single object or multiple objects at once.

Deleting objects should always be done via the **Storage API** and NOT via a **SQL query**. Deleting objects via a SQL query will not remove the object from the bucket and will result in the object being orphaned.

## Delete objects[#](#delete-objects)

To delete one or more objects, use the `remove` method.

```
1await supabase.storage.from('bucket').remove(['object-path-2', 'folder/avatar2.png'])
```

## RLS[#](#rls)

To delete an object, the user must have the `delete` permission on the object. For example:

```
1234567create policy "User can delete their own objects"on storage.objectsfor deleteTO authenticatedUSING (    owner = (select auth.uid()::text));
```
