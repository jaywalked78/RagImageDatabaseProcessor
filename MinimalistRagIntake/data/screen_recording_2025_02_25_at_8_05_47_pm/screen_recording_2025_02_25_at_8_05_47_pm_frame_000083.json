    "Summary": "This frame shows the n8n workflow editor, specifically the configuration panel for the 'Airtable Personal Access Token account' node, but now displaying an error. The 'Access Token' field contains a placeholder value, and an error message 'Problem in node 'Save to Airtable1' - Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?' is visible. The Airtable connection is currently failing, suggesting a credential issue.",

    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame contrasts with frame 81, where the Airtable connection test was successful. Frame 83 shows a failed connection with an error message, indicating a regression or a change in the configuration. The placeholder value in the 'Access Token' field suggests the user might have inadvertently cleared or reset the previously working token, leading to the 'Forbidden' error.  The user is now facing a credential issue with the Airtable connection and needs to re-verify or re-enter the correct Access Token.",
