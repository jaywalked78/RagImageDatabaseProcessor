    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame marks a significant context shift from the previous frames focused on n8n and OpenAI's Operator.  While seemingly disconnected from the immediate n8n workflow debugging, it could represent a broader step in planning and evaluating the infrastructure or services, specifically Google's Gemini API, that might underpin the AI automation solutions being built. It suggests a move from active workflow development and debugging back to a phase of research and planning, potentially considering the cost implications of using Gemini models.",
