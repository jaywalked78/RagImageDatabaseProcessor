    "Summary": "This frame shows the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, focused on the central section containing nodes such as 'Extract from File', 'Classify Document', 'File Upload Retry', and 'Google Gemini Chat Model'. The 'You have control' message from OpenAI's Operator remains visible at the bottom, indicating the user is still in manual control mode and reviewing the workflow.",
