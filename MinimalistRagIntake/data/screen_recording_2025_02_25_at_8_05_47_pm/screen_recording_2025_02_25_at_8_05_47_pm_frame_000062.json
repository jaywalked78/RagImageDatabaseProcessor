    "Summary": "This frame shows the OpenAI Operator interface after the user clicked 'Resume Operator' in the previous frame. The browser panel on the right displays a blurred webpage titled 'job application automation'. No loading indicator is visible, suggesting the page is loaded, but the content remains blurred. The 'Share' and 'Save task' buttons are visible in the Operator interface header, indicating readiness for further interaction.",
    "ToolsVisible": "OpenAI's Operator, Web Browser (within Operator's interface)",
    "ActionsDetected": "Webpage loaded within Operator (blurred), Waiting for Operator's next instructions or actions, Resumed interaction with Operator after manual n8n interaction",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: OpenAI's Operator, Browser panel title: 'job application automation', Loading indicator: Not visible (implies page load completion), UI elements: 'Share' and 'Save task' buttons visible, Browser content: Blurred webpage content visible",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 61, where the user clicked 'Resume Operator' after being in manual control and viewing the n8n workflow canvas. Frame 62 shows the Operator interface immediately after resuming control, presenting a familiar state with the blurred browser panel, likely awaiting the next step in the debugging or automation process.",
