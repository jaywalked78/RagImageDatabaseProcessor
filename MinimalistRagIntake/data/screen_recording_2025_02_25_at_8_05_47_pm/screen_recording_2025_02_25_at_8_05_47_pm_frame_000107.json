    "Summary": "Frame 107 shows the OpenAI Operator interface in split-screen mode. On the left, Operator's AI Assistant continues to provide debugging instructions for the 'Save to Airtable1' node, focusing on credential and configuration verification. The right side of the screen, presumably showing the n8n workflow editor, is blurred, suggesting Operator is still in the process of inspecting the 'Save to Airtable1' node settings as indicated in the chat.",
    "ToolsVisible": "OpenAI's Operator, n8n (blurred, inferred), Web Browser (inferred)",
    "ActionsDetected": "AI Assistant (Operator) continuing to provide debugging instructions, AI Assistant (Operator) indicating ongoing inspection of 'Save to Airtable1' node settings, User likely observing Operator's instructions and waiting for further guidance, No user interaction explicitly visible in this frame.",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: OpenAI's Operator, Tool: n8n (blurred, inferred), Interface: OpenAI Operator split-screen (chat panel left, blurred browser window right), Task Title: 'AI job application automation' (inferred from previous frames), Operator Instructions: '1. Verify that the correct Airtable credentials are selected.', '2. Ensure that the base and table names are correctly specified.', '3. Compare the configuration with the working \"Save to Airtable\" node to identify any differences.', Operator Action: 'I'll start by inspecting the \"Save to Airtable1\" node's settings to identify any discrepancies or issues.', Operator UI Element: 'Verifying settings for Airtable node' dropdown is visible but not expanded in this frame., Blurred content on the right likely represents the n8n workflow editor, but details are not discernible.",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 106, showing a very similar state where OpenAI's Operator is actively guiding the debugging process for the 'Save to Airtable1' node. The instructions provided are consistent, and the blurred right panel suggests Operator is still working in the background to inspect the node settings as mentioned in the chat.",
