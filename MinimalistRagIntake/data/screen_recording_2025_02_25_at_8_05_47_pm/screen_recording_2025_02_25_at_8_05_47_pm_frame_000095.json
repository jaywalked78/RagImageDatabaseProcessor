    "Summary": "Frame 95 shows the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The 'Workflow executed successfully' message from the previous frames is no longer visible. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, focusing on the 'Redirect to Application Form' and 'Submission Success' nodes, and the 'You have control' message with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator is still displayed at the bottom.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Noting the absence of the 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Reviewing workflow structure, particularly nodes related to form redirection and submission success, Considering 'Finish up' button, Likely about to conclude manual control and return to Operator",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Message: 'Workflow executed successfully' message - Not visible (transient message), Nodes prominently visible: Redirect to Application Form, Submission Success, Redirect To Step 2 of 2, Save to Applicant Tracking System, Save to Airtable, Upload File to Record, Node labels visible: Learn more about Form Ending, Next Form Page, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 94, maintaining the state after successful workflow execution but with the transient success message gone. The user continues to review the n8n workflow, likely in the final moments of manual control before relinquishing it back to OpenAI's Operator. The focus on 'Redirect to Application Form' and 'Submission Success' nodes suggests a review of the workflow's final steps and outcomes.",
