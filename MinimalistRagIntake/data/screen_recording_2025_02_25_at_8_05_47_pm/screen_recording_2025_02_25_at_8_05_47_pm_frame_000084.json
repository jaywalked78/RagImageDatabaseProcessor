    "Summary": "This frame shows the n8n workflow editor with a modal window 'Let Operator know what you changed' overlaid on top of the 'Save to Airtable1' node configuration. The user is presented with options to 'Exit to chat' or 'Resume Operator', indicating they are about to finish the manual control phase guided by OpenAI's Operator. The background still shows the 'Save to Airtable1' node configuration panel.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (implicit - control modal), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Concluding manual control phase, Viewing 'Let Operator know what you changed' modal, Choosing between 'Exit to chat' and 'Resume Operator', Preparing to return control to OpenAI's Operator, Potentially providing a summary of actions taken during manual control",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Node Configuration: Save to Airtable1 (in background), Modal Window Title: 'Let Operator know what you changed', Modal Prompt: 'Share a short summary to help Operator keep working smoothly.', Modal Input: 'What did you do while you had control? (Optional)' (Textarea visible), Modal Buttons: 'Exit to chat', 'Resume Operator' (highlighted), Message: Implicit 'You have control' phase ending, n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct consequence of the successful workflow execution seen in frames 76-79 and the subsequent Airtable configuration attempts in frames 81-83. Frame 84 signifies the completion of the 'You have control' phase, where the user likely addressed the Airtable connection issue (even though frame 83 showed an error, the user might have resolved it off-screen or is now moving to a different troubleshooting step). The modal prompts the user to summarize their actions before returning control to Operator, indicating a handover back to AI-driven guidance.",
