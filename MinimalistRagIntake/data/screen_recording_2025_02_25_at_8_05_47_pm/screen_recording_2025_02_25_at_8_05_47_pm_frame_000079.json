    "Summary": "This frame presents the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The 'Workflow executed successfully' message from the previous frames is no longer visible, indicating it was a transient notification. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, and the 'You have control' message with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator remains visible at the bottom, suggesting they are likely about to finish manual control and return to Operator.",

    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Noting absence of 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Considering 'Finish up' button, Likely preparing to click 'Finish up' and return control to Operator",

    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a continuation of frame 78, following the successful workflow execution. The disappearance of the 'Workflow executed successfully' message indicates the system has moved beyond that transient notification. The persistent 'You have control' and 'Finish up' elements suggest the user is at the point of concluding their manual interaction and returning control to OpenAI's Operator for the next phase of assistance.",
