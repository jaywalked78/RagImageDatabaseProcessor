    "Summary": "Frame 98 shows the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The 'Workflow executed successfully' message, seen in previous frames, is no longer visible. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, and the 'You have control' message along with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator are still present at the bottom, indicating the user is very likely about to conclude the manual control phase.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Noting the disappearance of the 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Reviewing the workflow after successful execution, Likely about to click 'Finish up' and return control to OpenAI's Operator",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Message: 'Workflow executed successfully' message - Not visible (transient message), Error Message: Not visible (previous errors resolved), Nodes visible: Application Form, Redirect To Step 2 of 2, Step 2 of 2 - Application Form, Save to Airtable1, Form Success, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive', Executions count: '0/1000 Executions'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 97, following the successful workflow execution. The transient 'Workflow executed successfully' message has now disappeared, as expected. The user remains in the n8n interface, still under manual control from OpenAI's Operator, and is highly likely in the process of finalizing their review before clicking 'Finish up' and returning control to the AI.",
