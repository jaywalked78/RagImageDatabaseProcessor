    "Summary": "Frame 113 showcases the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow, with the 'Workflow executed successfully' message clearly visible at the bottom right. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, confirming the successful execution once more, and the 'You have control' message with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator is persistently displayed, reinforcing the user's likely next step to conclude manual control.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Observing and confirming the consistent 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Reviewing the workflow interface after repeated successful execution indications, Likely finalizing review and preparing to click 'Finish up' to return control to OpenAI's Operator",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Message: 'Workflow executed successfully' (green popup at bottom right), Error Message: Not visible (previous errors resolved), Nodes visible: Submission Success, Redirect To Step 2 of 2, Node labels visible: Next Form Page, Form Ending, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Executions count: '0/1000 Executions', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 112, further emphasizing the successful workflow execution. The repeated confirmation of 'Workflow executed successfully' across frames 92-99, 111-113,  solidifies the successful resolution of previous errors and the consistent operational state of the workflow. The user is now highly likely to proceed with concluding manual control and returning to Operator's automated workflow.",
