    "Summary": "This frame displays the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, focusing on nodes like 'Extract from File', 'Classify Document', 'File Upload Retry', and 'Google Gemini Chat Model'.  The 'You have control' message from OpenAI's Operator is visible at the bottom, indicating manual control is still active.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Observing workflow diagram and node connections, Reviewing the central part of the workflow, Remaining in 'You have control' mode, likely for inspection",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Nodes prominently visible: Extract from File, Classify Document, File Upload Retry, Google Gemini Chat Model, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is likely a view after the user interacted with the 'Let Operator know what you changed' modal from frame 84 and potentially before Operator resumes automated actions as seen in frame 87. It shows the user back in the n8n workflow editor, still in manual control, possibly reviewing the workflow after the recent debugging and Airtable configuration attempts.",
