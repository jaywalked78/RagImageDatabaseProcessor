    "Summary": "Frame 101 is nearly identical to frame 100, continuing to display the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow with the persistent error message 'Problem in node 'Save to Airtable1' - Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?'. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, still focused on the 'Save to Airtable1' node and surrounding nodes, with the 'You have control' message and 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator remaining visible, indicating the Airtable credential issue persists and manual control continues.",

    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Observing persistent error message for 'Save to Airtable1' node, Analyzing Airtable connection error, Potentially still investigating Airtable credentials, Remaining in 'You have control' mode, still troubleshooting the error",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Error Message: 'Problem in node 'Save to Airtable1', Error Details: 'Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?', Nodes visible and labeled: Step 2 of 2 - Application Form, Save to Airtable1, Form Success, Application Form, Redirect To Step 2 of 2, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Executions count: '0/1000 Executions', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a virtually identical continuation of frame 100, showing the same persistent 'Forbidden' error for the 'Save to Airtable1' node. The Airtable credential issue remains unresolved, and the user is still in manual control, actively debugging or investigating the cause of the error. The successful workflow execution indicated in frames 92-99 seems to have been either a temporary success or a misleading indication, as the Airtable error has returned.",
