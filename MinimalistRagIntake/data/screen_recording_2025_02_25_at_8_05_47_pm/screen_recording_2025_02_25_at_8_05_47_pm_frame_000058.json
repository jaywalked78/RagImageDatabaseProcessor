    "Summary": "This frame shows the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow, with an 'Unpin workflow data' modal window open, highlighting the 'Save to Airtable' node. The modal prompts the user to unpin data associated with this node. OpenAI Operator's chat panel and AI Assistant panel are also visible, continuing to guide the user through debugging the 'Upload File to Record' node issue.",
