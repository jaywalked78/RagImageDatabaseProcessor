    "Summary": "Frame 99 displays the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The transient 'Workflow executed successfully' message from previous frames is no longer visible. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, focusing on nodes at the end of the workflow such as 'Application Form' and 'Form Success', and the 'You have control' message with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator is still present at the bottom, indicating the user is very likely about to conclude the manual control phase.",

    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Noting the disappearance of the 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Reviewing the end section of the workflow after successful execution, Likely about to click 'Finish up' and return control to OpenAI's Operator",

    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 98, following the successful workflow execution and the disappearance of the transient success message.
