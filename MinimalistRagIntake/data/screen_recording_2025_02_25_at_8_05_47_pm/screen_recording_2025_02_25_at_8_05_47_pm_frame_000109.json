    "Summary": "Frame 109 displays the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow. The user is viewing the workflow canvas. The 'You have control' message and 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator are visible at the bottom, indicating the user is still in manual control mode, likely in the final moments before relinquishing control back to Operator.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Observing workflow structure, Remaining in 'You have control' mode, Likely preparing to click 'Finish up' button",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Executions count: '0/1000 Executions', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 108, and likely represents the final moments of manual control in n8n. The user is viewing the workflow, seemingly ready to conclude the manual interaction and return control to OpenAI's Operator, as suggested by the presence of the 'Finish up' button and the loading/transitioning state in the previous frame.",
