    "Summary": "Frame 96 clearly shows the n8n workflow editor for the 'Handling Job Application Submissions' workflow, with the 'Workflow executed successfully' popup still present at the bottom right. The user is viewing the workflow canvas, and the 'You have control' message with the 'Finish up' button from OpenAI's Operator is prominently displayed, strongly suggesting the user is about to conclude the manual control phase and return to Operator's guidance.",
    "ToolsVisible": "n8n, OpenAI's Operator (control message), Web Browser",
    "ActionsDetected": "Viewing n8n workflow editor canvas, Observing persistent 'Workflow executed successfully' message, Reviewing the workflow interface after successful execution, Preparing to click 'Finish up' and return control to OpenAI's Operator",
    "TechnicalDetails": "Tool: n8n, Workflow Name: Handling Job Application Submissions, View: Editor (Workflow Canvas), Message: 'Workflow executed successfully' (green popup at bottom right), Error Message: Not visible (previous errors resolved), Nodes visible: Save to Applicant Tracking System, Redirect to Application Form, Submission Success, Redirect To Step 2 of 2, Save to Airtable, Upload File to Record, Message: 'You have control' (from Operator), Button: 'Finish up' (from Operator), n8n URL visible in browser address bar: `jaywalked.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/V6Y3yWDIl4DQMiLu`, Trial Status: '9 days left in your n8n trial', Inactive toggle is visible and set to 'Inactive'",
    "RelationshipToPrevious": "This frame is a direct continuation of frame 95, maintaining the successful workflow execution state. It further reinforces the successful outcome and the user's likely immediate next action of concluding manual control and returning to Operator's automated guidance. The consistent display of the 'Workflow executed successfully' message across multiple frames after resolving the Airtable error emphasizes the successful completion of the debugging and testing phase.",
