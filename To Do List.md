RAGDB Project Implementation To-Do List


This checklist will help organize and complete your RAG pipeline application, building on your existing OCR processing, chunking, and embedding functionality.



Phase 1: Codebase Organization & OCR Tool Isolation

[x] Create a complete backup of the current project directory
[x] Establish the following project structure:
- RAGDB/ (root)
- src/ (main application code)
- tools/ (standalone utilities)
- logs/ (log outputs)
- output/ (processing outputs)
- scripts/ (entry point scripts)
- venv/ (main virtual environment)
[x] Isolate the Sequential OCR tool:
[x] Create tools/sequential-ocr/ directory
[x] Move related files (run_.sh, sequential_.js, process_*.py) there
[x] Update path references in all scripts
[x] Update environment activation paths in shell scripts
[x] Document OCR tool setup:
[x] Decide whether to keep SecondaryVenv separate or merge dependencies
[x] Create README.md for the OCR tool explaining setup and usage
[x] Clean up the root directory by moving/archiving old scripts
[x] Initialize main environment (venv) and create requirements.txt


Phase 2: OCR Processing Improvements (Current Focus)

[x] Implement bi-directional processing for OCR:
[x] Create process_remaining_frames_reverse.js for Z-A processing
[x] Create process_remaining_frames_sequential.js for single-threaded processing
[x] Fix dependency errors in the OCR processing pipeline
[x] Ensure proper execution with environment variables
[ ] Create monitoring dashboard for OCR processing:
[ ] Add metrics collection for processing speed
[ ] Implement visualization of processing progress
[ ] Add email notifications for process completion
[ ] Improve error handling and recovery:
[ ] Implement automatic retry mechanisms
[ ] Create recovery scripts for interrupted processes
[ ] Add validation checks for processed data


Phase 3: Integrate & Verify Existing Ingestion Components

[ ] Identify and organize existing working code:
[ ] Move chunking logic to src/ingestion/chunking/
[ ] Move Voyager 3 embedding code to src/embedding/
[ ] Move Supabase storage code to src/database/
[ ] Refactor into modular functions/classes as needed
[ ] Update all import statements to reflect new file locations
[ ] Create central configuration in src/config/:
[ ] Set up proper .env file loading
[ ] Configure API keys and database connections
[ ] Verify database schema matches your plan:
[ ] Check frame_chunks table structure
[ ] Verify vector indexes are properly set up
[ ] Test ingestion pipeline:
[ ] Process sample frames through entire pipeline
[ ] Verify correct data is stored in Supabase
[ ] Confirm embeddings are properly stored
[ ] Create main ingestion script (scripts/run_ingestion.py)
[ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout pipeline


Phase 4: Complete Retrieval Pipeline Implementation

[ ] Implement any missing ingestion components:
[ ] LLM-based metadata structuring (if not already implemented)
[ ] Text representation generation for chunking
[ ] Build retrieval pipeline components:
[ ] Basic query handling (src/retrieval/query.py)
[ ] Query expansion with LLM (src/retrieval/expansion.py)
[ ] Self-querying/filtering (src/retrieval/filtering.py)
[ ] Query embedding with Voyager 3 (src/embedding/query.py)
[ ] Hybrid search implementation (src/retrieval/search.py)
[ ] Result fusion with RRF (src/retrieval/fusion.py)
[ ] Reranking implementation (src/retrieval/reranking.py)
[ ] Context assembly (src/retrieval/context.py)
[ ] Final LLM generation (src/llm/generation.py)
[ ] Create main retrieval script (scripts/run_retrieval.py)
[ ] Add configuration options:
[ ] Speed vs. accuracy model selection
[ ] Toggle for advanced retrieval features
[ ] Create comprehensive tests for retrieval pipeline
[ ] Document the full application architecture and usage


Phase 5: Optional Improvements

[ ] Implement better OCR parallelization:
[ ] Create queue-based system using Celery or multiprocessing
[ ] Refactor OCR processing into worker functions
[ ] Implement master script to distribute work
[ ] Build simple API or UI for querying the RAG system
[ ] Implement monitoring and metrics for pipeline performance
[ ] Create deployment documentation and scripts
